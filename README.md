# Lecture Series
-----------------

This series was created to address questions from various members of the OU Physics and Astronomy department. This will not give you a comprehensive knowledge of all things Linux/coding, but is aimed to give you a working knowledge of various systems. 

The series is aimed at 5 x 30min lectures with working examples and slides for interactive sessions.

## Each day has an `outline` file and a `README.md`. The `README.md` explains what each file and dir do. The outline details what the lecture is covering

## Day 1: Linux
 Basic Linux Tutorial: What is Linux? Most used commands, navigation, setting/manipulating your environment, locally installing programs without root permission, ssh vs vnc

## Day 2: Git
 Version Control: Mostly a focus on git (local) and then how this relates to Github

## Day 3: Personal Website
 How to create your own personal website (I include an easy template) using new <create.ou.edu> and <nhn.ou.edu>. What to put on there. Shorter lecture than others. ~15 minutes to not conflict with Wed. Seminars/Star Party

## Day 4: Python part 1
Controlling Python Versions/What are the differences. How to use pip and what modules to get? basic math, basic plotting, understanding functions

## Day 5: Python part 2
 Complex Functions, defining classes, module creation, multithreading vs multiprocessing
